- what is this? - 
yue is server frame work mainly designed for real-time network applicaiton like MMO
which uses persistent connection and batched RPC.
for the first time, yue development starts under japanese government subsidy (called MITOU project http://www.ipa.go.jp/jinzai/mitou/2009/2009_2/hontai/gaiyou/kk-1.html)

- coroutine based, efficient RPC execution (transparent from server to client, server to server) it will be perform over 400k qps on 1 connection batched RPC, 24k qps with 1000 connection
- easy to federate huge number of nodes and threads by using simple RPC (it looks like give single big user land environment)
- suitable for both multi-core single node and single core multi-node because yue's execution unit is native-thread of each node and its not distinguish remote and local
- build in websocket protocol and js library. you can use power of yue easily from html5 browser (test/websocket/yue.js and msgpack.js)


- installation - 
required: 
	ruby & python
	rake >= 0.8.7 (as make)
	scons >= 2.1.0 (as autotool, if you do not have scons installed, please use the one under tools directory)
	luajit >= 2.0.0
	
currently luajit installer does not create .so (but create .so.2) 
so you have to create .so link manually.

build:
	cd yue; rake; 

first play: 
        cd yue; rake run:server 
        open test/websocket/index.html with Chrome and press any button on html
        see test/lua/_3000.lua, test/lua/_3001.lua and see what yue does.

install:
	currently no installer implemented. you should install
	bin/yue => /usr/local/bin/yue
	bin/libyue.so(or dylib) => /usr/local/lib/lua/5.1/libyue.so
	bin/yue.lua => /usr/local/share/lua/5.1/yue.lua



- license - 
yue is planed to be released under license of LGPL, 
with some exception of usage (see license.txt).
