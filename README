- what is this? - 
yue is server frame work mainly designed for real-time network applicaiton like MMO
which uses persistent connection and batched RPC.
for the first time, yue development starts under japanese government subsidy (called MITOU project http://www.ipa.go.jp/jinzai/mitou/2009/2009_2/hontai/gaiyou/kk-1.html)

- coroutine based, efficient RPC execution (transparent from server to client, server to server)
- easy to federate huge number of nodes by using simple RPC (it looks like give single big user land environment)
- suitable for both multi-core single node and single core multi-node because yue's execution unit is native-thread of each node and its not distinguish remote and local



- installation -

	rake >= 0.8.7 (as make)
	scons >= 2.1.0 (as autotool)

currently luajit installer does not create .so (but create .so.2) 
so you have to create .so link manually.

	cd yue; rake;

install:
	currently no installer implemented. you should install
	bin/yue => /usr/local/bin/yue
