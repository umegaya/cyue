- what is this? - 
yue is server frame work mainly designed for real-time network applicaiton like MMO
which uses persistent connection and batched RPC.

- coroutine based, efficient RPC execution (transparent from server and client)
- easy to federate huge number of nodes by using simple RPC
- suitable for both multi-core single node and single core multi-node because yue's execution unit is native-thread of each node and its not distinguish remote and local



- installation - 
required: 
	luajit >= 2.0.0-beta8 
	tokyocabinet >= 1.3.2
	msgpack >= 0.1.0

currently luajit installer does not create .so (but create .so.2) 
so you have to create .so link manually.



- license - 
yue is planed to be released under license of LGPL, 
with some exception of usage (see license.txt).
