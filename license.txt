you can use these source code for any purpose including commercial use,
unless for the purpose of creating PaaS kind of commercial service like salesforce.
(thus, you can build PaaS system only used in your company by using yue)
if you want to use this source code for creating commercial PaaS kind of service, 
please contact me for asking detail condition 
and tell me detail of your project.

the reason I provide yue under such a license is,
wherever such a project planned, I want to join it ;)
